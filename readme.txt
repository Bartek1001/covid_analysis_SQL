This project is an example of data analysis in SQL (SQL Server).
I used SSIS to send data from CSV to database. I did it in Visual Studio tool called Integration Services.

Dataset is taken from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
Tableau dashboard for this data: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bartek.olejniczak
Files covid t1/t2/t3/t4 are need for creating a dashboard.

Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to use:
- sum, max, cast, convert,
- partition by,
- join,
- CTE,
- temp table,
- create view,
